Hi!  

I am a Masters by Research (M.Tech-RA) student at the Computer Science department, IIT-Hyderabad working with [Dr. Vineeth N Balasubramanian](https://www.iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/). I also work as a graduate visiting researcher at University of Toronto and Vector Institue with [Dr. Animesh Garg](https://animesh.garg.tech/).

I am broadly interested in problems related to computer vision and deep learning. My most recent works primarily focus on data-efficient learning (active learning, transfer learning, multi-modal learning), adversarial robustness, and Neural Architecture Search. Apart from this, I am also very interested in Applied ML projects that positively impact real-world, industry-related problems. 

Apart from my research, I like teaching (and therefore learning) state-of-the-art Applied ML concepts to students from diverse backgrounds. I work as a Small Group coach with [upGrad](https://www.upgrad.com/) where I help students understand various machine learning and data science concepts. Earlier, I served as a student mentor for Udacityâ€™s AI, ML, and Deep Learning Nanodegrees. 

<!-- Before I joined IIT-Hyderabad, I completed my undergraduate in 2018 from Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, [Keshav Memorial Institute Of Technology](https://kmit.in/) affiliated with [Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad](https://jntuh.ac.in/)   -->

I am always excited to talk and learn from people. If you have any questions / want to collaborate, feel free to drop a line by email!
