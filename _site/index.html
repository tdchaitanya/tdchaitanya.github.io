    <div class="article-wrap">
      <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I’m a Researcher at Fujitsu Research India, focusing on Generative AI and related applications. I gravitate towards problems at opposite ends of the spectrum - either those with clear practical applications or purely exploratory endeavors that spark curiosity. I completed my Master’s by Research (M.Tech-RA) in Computer Science from IIT-Hyderabad, where I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://people.iith.ac.in/vineethnb/">Prof. Vineeth N Balasubramanian</a>. During my graduate studies, I also had the opportunity to work as a visiting researcher at the University of Toronto and Vector Institute with <a href="https://animesh.garg.tech/">Prof. Animesh Garg</a>.</p>

<p>My research journey began in computer vision and deep learning during my Master’s, where I explored <a href="https://chaitanya.one/resume/Masters_Thesis_Chaitanya.pdf">Data-efficient learning</a> techniques including active learning, transfer learning, and multi-modal learning. Currently, my work spans the broader spectrum of Generative AI, where I combine research insights with engineering to deliver useful solutions. Throughout my academic career, I’ve maintained a strong connection to education and teaching, serving as a Teaching Assistant for various courses at IIT-Hyderabad and serving as mentor and coach with platforms like Udacity and UpGrad.</p>

<!-- Hi,

I'm an Researcher at Fujitsu Research India, where my work primarily revolves Generative AI. Specifically, I focus on integrating non-Euclidean learning approaches into computer vision problems. Prior to joining Fujitsu, I completed my Masters by Research (M.Tech-RA) in Computer Science from IIT-Hyderabad. I was fortunate to be advised by [Vineeth N Balasubramanian](https://www.iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/). During my Masters, I was also a graduate visiting researcher at the University of Toronto and Vector Institute with [Animesh Garg](https://animesh.garg.tech/).

My research interests are diverse but converge around computer vision and deep learning. Specifically, my previous works have been focused on data-efficient learning techniques such as active learning, transfer learning, and multi-modal learning. I have also explored topics such as adversarial robustness and Neural Architecture Search. Beyond solving research problems, I am also keen on applying machine learning to address real-world, industry-specific challenges.

While I have enjoyed a variety of teaching roles in the past, my current focus is on applied research. I used to serve as a Small Group coach at [upGrad](https://www.upgrad.com/), was a student mentor for Udacity's Nanodegree programs in AI, ML, and Deep Learning, and also worked as a Teaching Assistant at IIT-Hyderabad, where I was involved in creating assignments, content, and evaluation for various deep learning and machine learning courses.

<!-- Hi!  

I am a Masters by Research (M.Tech-RA) student at the Computer Science department, IIT-Hyderabad working with [Dr. Vineeth N Balasubramanian](https://www.iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/). I also work as a graduate visiting researcher at University of Toronto and Vector Institue with [Dr. Animesh Garg](https://animesh.garg.tech/).

I am broadly interested in problems related to computer vision and deep learning. My most recent works primarily focus on data-efficient learning (active learning, transfer learning, multi-modal learning), adversarial robustness, and Neural Architecture Search. Apart from this, I am also very interested in Applied ML projects that positively impact real-world, industry-related problems. 

Apart from my research, I like teaching (and therefore learning) state-of-the-art Applied ML concepts to students from diverse backgrounds. I work as a Small Group coach with [upGrad](https://www.upgrad.com/) where I help students understand various machine learning and data science concepts. Earlier, I served as a student mentor for Udacity’s AI, ML, and Deep Learning Nanodegrees.  -->

<!-- Before I joined IIT-Hyderabad, I completed my undergraduate in 2018 from Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, [Keshav Memorial Institute Of Technology](https://kmit.in/) affiliated with [Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad](https://jntuh.ac.in/)   -->
